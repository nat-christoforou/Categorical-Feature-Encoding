# Categorical Feature Encoding

Is there a cat in your dat?

A common task in machine learning pipelines is encoding categorical variables for a given algorithm in a format that allows as much useful signal as possible to be captured.

Because this is such a common task and important skill to master, we've put together a dataset that contains only categorical features, that will give you the opportunity 
to try different encoding schemes for different algorithms to compare how they perform
